# Recording

## Capture

openDAW allows you to capture and record audio and MIDI. To arm an audio-unit (essentially your instrument), please use
the tiny record button in the timeline track-header. You can arm as many audio-units as you like by holding the
shift-key.

By using the hamburger menu (Capture Audio or MIDI), you can filter on different devices and channels.

## Record

After arming as many tracks as you like to record multiple inputs simultaneously, you can record by pressing the red
record
button in the transport controls.

## Latency

Latency is the time between the computation of the audio and the signal being audible. Observe the **Latency** label in
the studio's footer, while using different audio output devices. The lower the number, the better. Do not use bluetooth
headphones or speakers. They add a lot of latency.

## Current State of Development

Recording does not respect loops.
