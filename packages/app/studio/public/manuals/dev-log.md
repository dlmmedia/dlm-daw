# Development

## Bugs

* Allow dropping devices in the timeline header column

## TODO

* Recording
    * Level #1
        * ~~List all devices~~
        * ~~If MIDI, select all channels or specific channel~~
        * ~~Arm buttons default behavior should be radio group (shift to add)~~
        * ~~Capture audio~~
          * layout channels
          * adjust pre-gain?
        * ~~MIDI Controller (values)~~
        * ~~Put Recording.start into class Project~~
        * ~~Stop (~~start~~) recording at quantized positions~~
        * Find a way to overlay, replace, mix on existing regions
        * Find a way to handle loops/jumps while recording
    * Level #2
        * Sample editor
        * Record samples into Playfield and clips (basically anywhere)
        * Better audio playback algorithms
            * time-stretch
            * event-based warping
        * Allow recording from other audio-units (baking)
* PianoModePanel
    * Show timeline navigation?
    * Different note labels for different countries (Global Switch)
    * ~~dialog? to disable note tracks~~
    * ~~Control to show and edit signature~~
    * ~~Scroll Y should change engine position (FW, RW)~~

    * ~~Transpose~~
    * ~~Go back to the timeline view~~
    * ~~Open MidiFall view (or Piano Tutorial Mode?)~~
    * ~~labels on falling notes (~~Hide when note is too short~~ clip)~~
    * ~~control to adjust visible time range~~
    * ~~active piano colors~~
    * ~~different keyboard layouts https://familypiano.com/blog/piano-keys-faq/~~
    * ~~time signature / octave (C, F) grid~~
* ~~Playfield bug: Samples appear louder when polyphone~~
* ~~Attach a CurveBox to ValueEventBox (enables having different curve shapes in future)~~
* Make effect-bypass parameter automatable
* Add SoundFont device
* AcceptingType for audio-unit should be a set?
* Admin sample management (rename, edit, delete)
* Do not use an unknown track for buses. This must be handled by the timeline view.

    * ~~Monophone / Polyphone switcher~~
* Stereo Tool
    * Stereo expander param is not really working
    * ~~Interpolate matrix~~
    * ~~swap channels~~

* Pre- & Post-gain FX / Gain-stage

### Optimisation

* Only produce and stream values in the audio-engine if there is a visible consumer in the user-interface

### Misc Bugs

* Setting a pointer to two different targets in one modification breaks undo

### Panel Management

* Resizers are only working on the adjacent elements.
* Resizers do not open/close panels while dragging to increase/decrease space
* Resizers on min-size and max-size should remember their size in pixels, not flex (example: Browser).
* No indicator that a panel reached min- or max-size
* Switching screen will rebuild ALL panels (should be reused if the screen contains the same panel-states)
